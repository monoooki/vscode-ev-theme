# Changelog

## 1.0.2

- Ev (light variants): Toolbar / action bar hover & pressed states now use neutral 20% black overlays to avoid washed-out buttons and keep icon/text colors stable.
- Ev (light variants): Primary button hover colors retuned per palette (Electric/Water/Grass/Ice/Fairy/Psychic/Normal) to stay near the base hue and eliminate red fallbacks.
- Ev (all variants): Input text in side panes uses the primary body text color for consistent legibility.
- Ev Psychic: Command palette (Command Center) foregrounds are explicitly pinned to primary/muted text so pressed states remain readable.

## 1.0.1

- (Ev Dark) Raised activity bar background to a high-visibility red for easier verification on Windows.
- (Ev Dark) Matched primary button hover with extension buttons so both use the brighter yellow highlight.
- (Ev Dark) Switched search/input text color to the primary (white-ish) text for better legibility.
- (Ev Dark) Darkened focus borders to the primary accent to reduce glare around active panes.
- (Ev Dark) Brightened title bar foregrounds (active/inactive) for improved menu/icon visibility.

## 1.0.0

- Initial collection bundle: Normal + Dark/Electric/Fire/Water/Grass/Ice/Fairy/Psychic in one VS Code extension
