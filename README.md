# Ev for VS Code

![hero](assets/hero.png)

Ev is a collection of nine palette variants: a base **Normal** look plus
dark, electric, fire, water, grass, ice, fairy, and psychic-inspired palettes.
Each variant uses the same underlying UI structure with color tuning to match
its theme.

## Key Features

- **One bundle, nine looks** – switch between Normal, Dark, Electric, Fire,
  Water, Grass, Ice, Fairy, and Psychic without installing separate themes.
- **Shared layout, tuned palettes** – all variants reuse the same UI structure
  with per-palette adjustments designed to keep panels, tabs, and git states
  readable.
- **ANSI and editor alignment** – terminal palettes follow the same accents as
  the editor for consistent screenshots and demos.
- **Light/dark mix** – Dark is the nocturnal variant; the others are
  light-leaning without blowing out contrast.
